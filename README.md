<h1 align="center">2D Platformer</h1>


<h3>Small Overview</h3>  

This platformer was made during an OOP programming class using a custom engine provided by my teacher. 
The engine found in the filesystem of the platformer was modified to manage the tilesheets from the program
Tiled.

Also, it uses the <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson" >Jacskon JSON parser</a> for java library.
